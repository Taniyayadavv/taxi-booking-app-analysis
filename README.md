# taxi-booking-app-analysis
Hi all,

This Python data analysis project delves into taxi booking data to extract valuable insights. It encompasses several key aspects:

1) Data Preparation: The project begins by preparing the dataset. This involves deriving essential features such as pickup and dropoff months, and days of the week from timestamps.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The core of the project involves EDA. It provides answers to questions like:

(i)How many people have booked taxis?
(ii)What are the pickup and dropoff patterns throughout the day?
(iii)Are there variations in pickups and dropoffs on different days of the week?
(iv)Is there seasonality in taxi bookings throughout the year?

3) Visualization: To make the insights more accessible, the project employs data visualization techniques. Graphs and charts help in presenting trends and patterns effectively.

4) Usage: A clear set of instructions is provided for users to replicate and customize the analysis. These steps include downloading the dataset, running Jupyter notebooks, and adapting the code to suit specific requirements.
